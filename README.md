# Start-Line

## Description

This project was made with the idea of helping those new to the fitness world. It's anxiety-inducing to try something new without a starting point, so this website is meant to be that (the 'start-line').

The 'Contact Us' button will present a modal

The modal itself takes in your name, email, phone, and an optional message to contact us.

As for the nutrient's guide: The inputs will take in your information and use it to generate a guide. The guide itself will show you your estimated BMI, the calories you need per day, and nutrients you'll need.
